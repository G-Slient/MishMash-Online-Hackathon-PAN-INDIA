9. **Deep Tech - Problem Statement - 3:** 
- We have provided both the models.


## üî• Your Pitch
1. We have experimented with **almost all the models** and picked the **best model i.e XG Boost**.
2. Forecasting was applied on **both the datasets.**
3. We have created a **baseline of all the models.**
4. In our approach, we have used the **aggregated train data for building models**, which gave better results than the non-agrregated data.
5. **Bayesian Approach** was also used for forecast the data for both the datasets.
